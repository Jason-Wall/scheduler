# Interview Scheduler

Interview Scheduler is a single page application that allows students to book appointments with mentors.\
This project was built over one week as a project for Lighthouse Labs (LHL). Students were required to create React components and test them using Cypress, Storybook, and Jest. The back end was provided by LHL ([Original Repo](https://github.com/lighthouse-labs/scheduler/)).
